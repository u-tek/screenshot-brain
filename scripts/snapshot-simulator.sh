#
#   scripts/snapshot-simulator.sh key "iPhone 16 Pro"     prints the cache key for this runner
#   scripts/snapshot-simulator.sh start "iPhone 16 Pro"   puts a cached copy in place, then boots it in the background
#   scripts/snapshot-simulator.sh save "iPhone 16 Pro"    shuts it down and copies it into the cache folder
#
# A new simulator's first boot spends minutes setting itself up; a copy that has booted once
# starts far faster. The copy lives in $SB_SIM_CACHE (default ~/sb-simulator) for actions/cache.
# It only suits the same runner image, Xcode and iOS runtime, so the key names all three. If the
# boot also built the runtime's shared cache, that is kept too.
#
# The simulator is called "Snapshots <phone>" so it never mixes with the runner's own.
# Timings go to build/simulator.log.
